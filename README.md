# 🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python)

A simple **cybersecurity project** in Python that checks the strength of a given password.  
It evaluates passwords based on **length, character variety, entropy**, and checks against the **Have I Been Pwned API** for known breaches.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Checks password length and complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)  
- ✅ Calculates **entropy** to measure randomness  
- ✅ Uses [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API to detect if the password has been leaked  
- ✅ Classifies passwords as **Very Weak → Very Strong**
